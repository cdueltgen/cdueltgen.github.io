# Hello there!

I've been wanting to have a place to put my CTF writeups and other thoughts
as well as things I've found interesting on my cybersecuriy journey, and I
didn't really want to put them on someone else's site, so here we are. Now I
guess I've got to actually put some things here, huh?

## A little bit about me

I've been doing computer-y things for 40 years now, probably more if you count
the fact that my elementary school in MN had a dial-up connection to the U to
play the original ASCII-based Oregon Trail game as well as having on the PET-32
computers in the libraray. I've been fascinated ever since. I did my first
graphics coding on an Apple IIe. In school, I technically studied Computer
Science, but mostly what I got out of my degree was the knowledge that I didn't
want to be a full-time coder. My job in school, however, was a different deal.
I was lucky enough to work with the folks at Academic Computing, first in a
help desk role for a couple of years, and then moving into contract network
services (shoutout to my DSS peeps) where I learned the fundamentals that
are still serving me well to this day. That's the first time I read a packet.
It was cool. I was hooked. I still love reading packets today, and am
thoroughly grateful that I don't have to do each one by hand anymore.

I have had a varied and interesting career doing everything from on-prem SRE
work to making pictures in movies, teaching python to beginners to working
with large enterprises in a customer engineering role at Heroku. Recently,
I've come back to my first love, which it turns out is now called
cybersecurity and is way more involved than the last time I did this sort
of work. I've been studying up, and I got some certs to fill in the blanks
(GSEC, GCIH) and am now looking for my first official infosec role. If you
know someone who's hiring, I'm looking for a Detection and Response role.
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiadueltgen/).

I love CTFs and plan on adding writeups of interesting challenges here as I
come across them and find the time to write them up. I hope you enjoy!
